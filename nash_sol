In Java, a String is the type of object that can store a sequence of characters enclosed by double quotes and every character is stored in 16 bits, i.e., using UTF 16-bit encoding. A string acts the same as an array of characters. Java provides a robust and flexible API for handling strings, allowing for various operations such as concatenation, comparison and manipulation.

public class hft {

    // Main Function
    public static void main(String args[])
    {

        // creating Java string using a new keyword
        String str = new String("hft");

        System.out.println(str);
    }
}
